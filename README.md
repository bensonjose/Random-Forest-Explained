# What is Random Forest?

**Random forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm trademarked by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler,
which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result.<br>
Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.**

**Advantages of random forest**

**A random forest produces good predictions that can be understood easily. <br>It can handle large datasets efficiently.<br> The random forest algorithm provides a higher level of accuracy in predicting outcomes over the decision tree algorithm.**
